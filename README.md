# AP Computer Science Principles

This repository contains various AP Computer Science Principles assignments. Assignments were included if I felt they involved a significant amount of problem solving or creative thinking.

## Content

* **Turtle Maze:** A turtle object uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to navigate through a recursively generated maze.
* **Turtle Tower Defense:** Turtle objects represent towers, enemies, and the field in a tower defense game.
* **Boids:** An implementation of the boids algorithm using turtles as each body.
* **Sierpinsky:** Turtles are used to recursively draw Sierpinsky's triangle.
* **Honey Data Analysis:** Analyzes a .csv file containing a large set of honey production data categorized by year, state, and other criteria. The data is graphed into 4 separate subplots using the matplotlib and pandas libraries.
* **Command Line GUI:** A GUI is created for simple terminal commands, accomodating Linux and Windows terminals.
